# Titlecase Pipe

## Description
The `TitlecasePipe` is an Angular custom pipe that transforms a given string into title case. This means that the first letter of each word in the string is capitalized, while the rest of the letters are converted to lowercase.

## Usage
To use the `TitlecasePipe`, you need to import it into your Angular module. Once imported, you can use it in your templates to format strings.

## Notes
- The pipe will return an empty string if the input value is falsy (e.g., `null`, `undefined`, or an empty string).
